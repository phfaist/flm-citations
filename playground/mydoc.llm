\section{Section Title}

Hi there!  This is my document~\cite{arxiv:1211.3141}.

What's up with~\cite{arxiv:2009.04469,arxiv:2208.06306}?  I can also
check~\cite{manual:{Me \emph{et al.}, Journal of Results I Should Have Published
Earlier (2022)}}.  Also a
citation~\cite{b:Li2022arXiv_wasserstein,b:PreskillNotes} from my own
bibliography file which I provided here.
